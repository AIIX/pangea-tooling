We emphasise three things:\n\n 1. Free of Charge. Ubuntu is absolutely free of charge, and will remain that way.\n\n 2. Licence Freedom. Ubuntu includes only Free Software applications. You are free to modify or change any aspect of your Ubuntu system.\n\n 3. Ease of Use. We aim to make Ubuntu the easiest version of Linux to install and use immediately. We put a lot of effort into making sure that the default configuration is comprehensive but sane, so that you will find your new desktop familiar but not overwhelming.\n\nUbuntu also includes more software than any other operating system, on its network of software repositories. Once your system is installed you can simply call up a list of all the existing tools out there and choose any of them for immediate installation over the internet.\n", "permit_obsolete_series_uploads": true, "relative_build_score": 0, "name": "primary", "distribution_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/devel/ubuntu", "web_link": "https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary", "owner_link": "https://api.launchpad.net/devel/~ubuntu-archive", "signing_key_fingerprint": null}
